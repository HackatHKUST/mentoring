Text Editors
===========================

Getting Your Code on Paper
------------------------

If you already have a favorite text editor (Note: Word, Google Docs, or any other word processing software are NOT text editors. They are documents software, and that is a BIG DIFFERENCE), feel free to use that. For the purposes of learning, we recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). To do so, please click on the “Download” bar at the top and download either Sublime Text 3 or the newest version of Sublime Text 2. Once you have it downloaded, you can use it to create plain-text files for whatever kind of language you are using. Name your file with the correct extension (.html for HTML, .js for JavaScript, .hs for Haskell, etc) and Sublime should automatically recognize it and highlight it appropriately.

You should also install the Sublime Package Manager, which lets you extend the functionality of Sublime Text with pre-written packages. To install the package manager, visit [this site](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2) and follow the instructions for your version of Sublime (Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3). 

Then you can visit [here](https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/usage) for an easy description of how to use the package manager, and [come here](https://sublime.wbond.net/search) to look for some cool packages to install (you can also search from Sublime itself).
