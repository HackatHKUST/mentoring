PennApps Mentoring
============
We think hackathons should be about learning and meeting new people, so we're here to make it happen. Read all about our initiatives, and join us for a new kind of mentoring experience!

<!--- -->


###Beginner Guides
To help you learn to hack we have our archive of [tech talks](./TechTalks.html) and [content](./toc.html) developed by the team on lots of useful topics. 

###The Dining Philosophers Partnership

PennApps has teamed up with The Dining Philosophers to teach new hackers the basics of hacking! The Dining Philosophers has a bunch of homegrown workshops and tutorials on all sorts of useful subjects for new hackers like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [Click here](http://dinphil.github.io) to see all the information from the tutorials, including slides, and code samples. There are also ideas for good projects for new hackers.

###At PennApps

Before PennApps you should sign up to be a [mentor](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UrD85sE_KSKmRjiAHjWeyPaAEVDaaj24LCZNCb06A50/edit?usp=sharing). At check-in at PennApps you can sign-up to be mentored.

At PennApps there will be several events for our new hackers. On Friday, we'll be having a mentorship dinner where you can mix and mingle with the mentors to find out how they can be most useful to you throughout the hackathon. The hub of mentoring will be in the Accenture Engineering Cafe located in the Levine Building of the engineering quad. This is where you're most likely to find mentors as well. To reach out to mentors from where you're hacking or if they're not in the Cafe check out [my.pennapps.com](https://my.pennapps.com/login) for the mentor database. The mentor database has a list of all registered mentors and their technical skills.
