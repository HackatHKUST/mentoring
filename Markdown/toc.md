If you are new to programming, we strongly recommend that you start by building a personal website. It does not have to be fancy (just some information about you, links to social media, and a basic design will work), but it will give you experience designing a basic “app” and publishing it for the world to see! Check out [Pranav](http://pvrnav.com) and [Derek's](http://derekjobst.com/) for some design inspiration. We reccommend you read through the HTML/CSS and Git guids as this is how you make a personal website

If you’ve had some basic experience and feel comfortable with your ability to build and deploy an app look at some of the more advanced guides.

The internet has a lot of helpful reasources to help you sort through troubleshooting your code and learn new code. Three extremely helpful reasources are: [Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com), [Bento box](https://teamtreehouse.com/signup_code/hackru), and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). You should try searching something on each of these websites now to familiarize yourself with the setup.
