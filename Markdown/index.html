<p>Before PennApps you should sign up to be a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UrD85sE_KSKmRjiAHjWeyPaAEVDaaj24LCZNCb06A50/edit?usp=sharing">mentor</a>. At check-in at PennApps you can sign-up to be mentored.</p>

<p>At PennApps there will be several events for our new hackers. On Friday, we'll be having a mentorship dinner where you can mix and mingle with the mentors to find out how they can be most useful to you throughout the hackathon. The hub of mentoring will be in the Accenture Engineering Cafe located in the Levine Building of the engineering quad. This is where you're most likely to find mentors as well. To reach out to mentors from where you're hacking or if they're not in the Cafe check out <a href="https://my.pennapps.com/login">my.pennapps.com</a> for the mentor database. The mentor database has a list of all registered mentors and their technical skills.</p>
