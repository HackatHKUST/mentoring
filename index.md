We think hackathons should be about learning and meeting new people, so weâ€™re here to make it happen. Read all about our initiatives, and join us for a new kind of mentoring experience!

##Beginner Guides
To help you learn to hack we have our archive of [tech talks](./TechTalks) and [content](./guide) developed by the team on lots of useful topics. 

##Mentor Pairing

+ You submit a request online at [live.pennapps.com](live.pennapps.com) detailing your question or issue.

+ The PennApps Mentorship team receives the request and finds an available mentor that we believe fits your needs.

+ The Mentorship team sends you an email with the mentor's contact information.
Once you receive an email, please contact the mentor and arrange a place to meet. We suggest Mentorship Central, located in the Engineering Cafe, as an easily identifiable location. If you have any questions, feel free to come to Mentorship Central.

##The Dining Philosophers Partnership

PennApps has teamed up with The Dining Philosophers to teach new hackers the basics of hacking! The Dining Philosophers has a bunch of homegrown workshops and tutorials on all sorts of useful subjects for new hackers like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. [Click here](http://dinphil.github.io) to see all the information from the tutorials, including slides, and code samples. There are also ideas for good projects for new hackers.

##At PennApps

Before PennApps, you should sign up to be a [mentor](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jTVRzgrWkAb4unBnGMJpPiAA-dQxm3yb3-FNhWPg8tw/viewform?usp=send_form). At PennApps, you can request a mentor any time you want through [my.pennapps.com/mentor](https://my.pennapps.com/mentor).

At PennApps there will be several events for our new hackers. Friday night, we'll be having some intro to hacking talks on topics like HTML/CSS, [iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNa1GEXQZJg), [Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1M1zBkxVX0), and web technologies. There will also be a team formation event on Friday. You'll be able to find mentors in the Mentor Hub for most of the weekend!
