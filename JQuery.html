<p>JQuery</p>

<p>JQuery is a helpful Javascript library that makes possible to bring webpages to life without going insane. It provides helpers for DOM manipulation, event binding, AJAX requests, and even animations. JQuery is compatible with nearly all browsers (including oldies like IE) and has a wide range of plugins available that extend its functionality even further.</p>

<p>This guide will assume some knowledge of programming and HTML/CSS but extensive practice of Javascript will not be required to understand it. However, the better you know the language the more dangerous youâ€™ll be when you sit down to program. For an excellent primer in the Javascript language (as well as a look at how miserable events are without JQuery!), <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">go here</a>.</p>
