If you're new to programming, we strongly recommend that you start by building a personal website. It doesn't have to be fancy (just some information about you, links to social media, and a basic design will work), but it will give you experience designing a basic “app” and publishing it for the world to see! Check out [Pranav](http://pvrnav.com) and [Derek's](http://derekjobst.com/) for some design inspiration. We reccommend you read through the HTML/CSS and Git guides for this project. Before anything else, though, read about text editors.

If you’ve had some basic experience and feel comfortable with your ability to build and deploy an app look at some of the more advanced guides.

The internet has a lot of helpful reasources to help you sort through troubleshooting your code and learn new code. Three extremely helpful reasources are: [Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com), [Bento box](https://teamtreehouse.com/signup_code/hackru), and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
