            <!--Tech Talks, Code Weekend, Social-->
            <h3>Code Weekend</h3>
                <p>PennApps has teamed up with PennCC to teach new hackers how to make webapps. Code Weekend will be two days of learning on Saturday September 6 and Sunday September 7 in the Penn Engineering quad. (Exact location and time TBA). <br> Need to put how to sign up.</p>
            <h3>Newbie Social</h3>
                <p>Come play Cards Against Humanity and get to know other hackers! On September 8/9/10 we would like to help you get know people that you could hack with as finding a team during PennApps can be a little daunting if you don't know people.</p>
            <h3>Tech Talks</h3>
                <p>Companies that sponsor PennApps and other awesome programmers are giving talks the weekend before PennApps about all sorts of tools to help you build cooler apps! See the schedule here:...</p>
