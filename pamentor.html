            <!--Tech Talks, Code Weekend, Social-->
          
            <h2>Code Weekend</h2>

                <p>PennApps has teamed up with The Dining Philosophers to teach new hackers how to make web apps. Code Weekend was two days of learning on Saturday September 6 and Sunday September 7 in the Penn Engineering quad.</p>
    
                <p>There were four tutorials over the course of the weekend. The first was about the basics of the Internet, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and how they interact on a web page. The second was an introduction to Node. Talk three went over how to integrate the Venmo API into a Node app, and the fourth was about MongoDB integration.</p>
