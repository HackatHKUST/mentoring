Main Title: MENTOR GUIDE
Hello Mentors! We greatly appreciate your willingness to assist hackers with building something new at PennApps. If this is your first time mentoring, or even your first time at a hackathon, don’t worry! This guide has you covered.

Section 1: HOW IT WORKS

Location: Mentorship Central will be located in the Engineering Cafe. If you have any trouble locating it, please consult the included map or ask a member of the PennApps organizing staff or volunteers. 

Pairing System: Hackers will be able to submit their problems/issues online at live.pennapps.com and get matched up with mentors who are experts in that area. After a question is submitted, the PennApps Mentorship Team will be pairing mentors and hackers based on best fit. Hackers will receive an email with your information when they are paired with you -- so remember to check your phone or computer often! You will not receive an email when a match occurs. If you or anyone you know wants to register as a mentor, needs to change your contact information/method, or add/remove skills, please come to Mentorship Central and we can do that for you.

Checking in and out: When you get to PennApps, remember to drop by Mentorship Central to check-in so that we can start sending hackers your way through the pairing system. When you leave, come by and check-out so that we know to no longer send hackers your way. You can also shoot us an email at mentoring@pennapps.com to check in and out.

Section 2: WHAT TO KNOW
While the hackers do most of the heavy lifting, sometimes they’ll run into roadblocks and might request some assistance. This is your chance to shine and represent yourself and your company. 

When you filled out the mentor survey, you indicated particular technical areas that you could help with. We will be primarily using those areas to guide us in finding the appropriate mentor for a hacker. If you find you do not know how to solve their issue, no worries! Feel free to point the hacker back to Mentorship Central or to the online pairing system so that we can try and find another mentor. 

Section 3: Do’s and Dont’s
Although it may be tempting to immediately solve the hackers’ challenges yourself, talk them through it and try to let them figure it out on their own. After all, this is a tremendous opportunity for them to grow!

DO...
Talk them through the issues that they’re facing
Point out additional resources that would benefit them
Online tutorials, on-site workshops, etc.
Be encouraging and optimistic!
Offer helpful advice/tips/tricks/habits
DON’T...
Solve their problems for them
Leave before they seem to be on the right track
Give up!
 
If you ever have any questions, do not hesitate to drop by Mentorship Central or find a PennApps staff/volunteer member. We are here to help!
